Archetype-Utilities
===================

Utility functions and mixins built in Sass and Compass. Archetype-Utilities was
specifically designed to suplement
[Archetype](https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype) but it can just as easily
be used within any Compass project.

Formal documentation hasn't yet been tackled, but the code is fairly well
commented. Many code snippets have been borrowed from other developers. Links to original
repositories are included inline.

## Installation
Archetype-Utilities is automatically included when installing Archetype via
[Compass Extension](https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype-Compass).

When installing Archetype [via
Git](https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype#installation) you'll need to
install Archetype-Utilities individually and then include it within you
project.

```
$ cd ~/path/to/your/projects/sass/directory/
$ git clone https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype-Utilities.git

```

Then you can include all of Archetype-Utilities within your main Sass partial:

```
$ @import 'archetype';
```

Or, you can include a specific component:

```
$ @import 'archetype/clearfix';
```
